Welcome to my collection of computer science lessons â€” crafted to teach real concepts with real code.

These lessons are written in Markdown and rendered using Marp to create clean, scrollable slides. They're built for visual teaching, easy walkthroughs, and coding side-by-side.

ðŸŽ¯ Topics focus on core CS fundamentals like algorithms, data structures, and patterns â€” all taught through C++ and explained with intuition, diagrams, and real-world LeetCode examples.

ðŸ§  My goal is to help you *understand*, not just memorize â€” so you can solve problems faster and smarter.

ðŸŽ¥ These slides are used in my YouTube videos where I teach these exact concepts with drawing + code + walkthroughs.

Thanks for stopping by â€” and happy learning.
